# Contributing to shimmytok

Thanks for your interest in contributing to shimmytok!

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Maintainer-Only Pull Requests

**Pull requests are restricted to approved maintainers only.** Unsolicited PRs will be declined. To contribute code, you must first apply for maintainer status by emailing michaelallenkuykendall@gmail.com.

**Non-maintainers can contribute by:**
- Opening issues for bugs or feature requests
- Participating in GitHub Discussions
- Providing feedback and testing
- Reporting tokenization issues with specific models

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/foo`)
2. Make your changes with clear commits and tests if applicable
3. **Sign off your commits** (required): `git commit -s -m "Your message"`
4. Run existing tests to ensure nothing breaks (`cargo test`)
5. Ensure code quality (`cargo fmt && cargo clippy`)
6. Open a Pull Request against `main`

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions must be signed off with the Developer Certificate of Origin. This certifies that you have the right to contribute your code. See [DCO.md](DCO.md) for details.

**Quick setup:**
```bash
git config format.signoff true  # Auto sign-off all commits
```

## Code Style

- Rust 2021 edition
- Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before submitting
- Keep PRs small and focused - large refactors may be rejected
- Add tests for new functionality
- Document public APIs with rustdoc comments

## Contribution Scope

Features should align with the **shimmytok philosophy**:
- **Pure Rust**: No C++ dependencies
- **GGUF-focused**: Direct loading from model files
- **llama.cpp compatible**: Match reference implementation
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, focused scope
- **Correctness over performance**: Get it right first

## What We Welcome

- Bug fixes with test cases
- Tokenization correctness improvements
- GGUF format compatibility enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage improvements
- New model support (with llama.cpp validation)

## What We Generally Reject

- Features that add heavy dependencies
- Complex configuration systems
- Breaking changes to public API
- Performance optimizations that sacrifice correctness
- Features not aligned with llama.cpp

## Review Process

**IMPORTANT: Pull Request Access is Restricted**
- Only approved maintainers may submit pull requests
- All contributions from non-maintainers will be declined
- Code contributions require pre-approval via maintainer application process

**For Approved Maintainers:**
- All PRs require review and approval from the lead maintainer
- Merge authority is reserved to maintain project direction
- We aim to review PRs within 1-2 business days
- Constructive feedback will be provided for rejected PRs

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Michael-A-Kuykendall/shimmytok
cd shimmytok
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run specific test suites
cargo test --test test_comprehensive  # llama.cpp validation
cargo test --test test_error_handling # Error cases

# Check formatting and linting
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## Testing Requirements

- All new tokenizer implementations must have llama.cpp validation tests
- Error handling must have negative test cases
- Round-trip tests (encode â†’ decode) must pass
- Edge cases (emoji, Unicode, whitespace) must be covered

## Maintainer Process

### Current Maintainer Structure
- **Lead Maintainer**: Michael A. Kuykendall (@Michael-A-Kuykendall)
- **Additional Maintainers**: Currently none (solo-maintained project)

### Becoming a Maintainer

Currently, shimmytok is maintained by a single maintainer to ensure consistent quality and vision. **Code contributions require pre-approved maintainer status.**

**To apply for maintainer status:**

1. **Private Application**: Email michaelallenkuykendall@gmail.com with:
   - Your GitHub username and relevant experience
   - Area of expertise (e.g., tokenization algorithms, GGUF format, Rust)
   - Time commitment you can provide
   - Why you'd like to help maintain shimmytok

2. **Evaluation Process**: Applications are reviewed when additional maintainers are needed
3. **No Unsolicited PRs**: Code contributions without prior approval will be declined

### Maintainer Responsibilities

When additional maintainers are added, they will:
- Review and approve pull requests
- Triage and respond to issues
- Maintain code quality standards
- Validate tokenization correctness against llama.cpp
- Uphold the shimmytok philosophy and project direction

*Note: The project may remain solo-maintained until contribution volume requires additional help.*
